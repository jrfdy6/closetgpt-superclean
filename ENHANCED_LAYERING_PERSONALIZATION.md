# Enhanced Layering System with Personalization Features

## Overview

The enhanced layering system now incorporates **skintone**, **style preference**, and **body type** considerations to provide truly personalized outfit recommendations. This goes beyond basic temperature-based layering to create outfits that are not only weather-appropriate but also flattering and aligned with individual preferences.

## Key Personalization Features

### 1. Skin Tone Color Compatibility

The system analyzes how clothing colors complement different skin tones:

#### Supported Skin Tones
- **Warm**: Coral, peach, gold, olive, terracotta, warm red, orange, yellow, brown
- **Cool**: Blue, purple, pink, silver, cool red, emerald, teal, navy
- **Neutral**: Navy, gray, white, black, beige, mauve, rose, sage
- **Olive**: Olive, sage, mauve, rose, camel, brown, cream
- **Deep**: Deep red, purple, emerald, navy, gold, cream, white
- **Medium**: Blue, green, purple, pink, coral, navy, gray
- **Fair**: Navy, gray, rose, sage, cream, soft pink

#### Color Analysis Logic
```python
# Example: Warm skin tone analysis
warm_colors = {
    'flattering_colors': ['coral', 'peach', 'gold', 'olive', 'terracotta'],
    'avoid_colors': ['cool_blue', 'silver', 'cool_pink', 'purple'],
    'neutral_colors': ['cream', 'beige', 'warm_white', 'camel', 'tan']
}
```

### 2. Body Type Layering Recommendations

The system provides body type-specific layering advice:

#### Body Type Support
- **Hourglass**: Fitted tops, belted waist, structured jackets, wrap styles
- **Pear**: Fitted tops, structured jackets, longer tops, dark bottoms
- **Apple**: Longer tops, structured jackets, dark colors, V-necks
- **Rectangle**: Layered looks, belts, structured pieces, textured layers
- **Inverted Triangle**: Darker tops, lighter bottoms, V-necks, longer tops
- **Athletic**: Fitted pieces, structured layers, textured fabrics, belts
- **Curvy**: Fitted tops, structured jackets, wrap styles, belted waist

#### Body Type Analysis Example
```python
# Example: Pear body type recommendations
pear_recommendations = {
    'flattering_layers': ['fitted_tops', 'structured_jackets', 'longer_tops'],
    'avoid_layers': ['short_tops', 'light_bottoms', 'tight_bottoms'],
    'layer_priorities': ['draw_attention_up', 'balance_lower_body', 'create_length']
}
```

### 3. Style Preference Layering Patterns

The system adapts layering approaches based on style preferences:

#### Supported Style Preferences
- **Minimalist**: Clean lines, monochromatic, simple layers, structured pieces
- **Bohemian**: Flowy layers, textured fabrics, mixed patterns, natural materials
- **Streetwear**: Oversized layers, sporty pieces, mixed styles, bold statements
- **Classic**: Timeless layers, structured pieces, quality fabrics, refined looks
- **Romantic**: Soft layers, flowy fabrics, feminine details, delicate layers
- **Edgy**: Bold layers, contrasting pieces, mixed materials, statement layers
- **Casual**: Comfortable layers, easy pieces, practical layers, relaxed fits
- **Formal**: Structured layers, quality fabrics, refined details, professional looks

#### Style Analysis Example
```python
# Example: Classic style recommendations
classic_style = {
    'layer_approach': ['timeless_layers', 'structured_pieces', 'quality_fabrics'],
    'preferred_layers': ['blazer', 'structured_jacket', 'cardigan', 'coat'],
    'avoid_layers': ['trendy_pieces', 'oversized_layers', 'casual_layers']
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Personalization
```python
# Get personalized recommendations
suggestions = get_personalized_layering_suggestions(
    items=outfit_items,
    temperature=75.0,
    skin_tone='warm',
    body_type='hourglass',
    style_preferences=['classic', 'minimalist']
)

print(suggestions['personalized'])
# Output: [
#   "Consider colors like coral, peach, gold for your warm skin tone",
#   "For your hourglass body type, focus on: define_waist, balance_proportions",
#   "For classic style, try: blazer, structured_jacket"
# ]
```

### Comprehensive Validation
```python
# Get comprehensive validation
validation = get_enhanced_layering_validation(
    items=outfit_items,
    temperature=75.0,
    user_profile={
        'skinTone': 'warm',
        'bodyType': 'hourglass',
        'stylePreferences': ['classic', 'minimalist']
    }
)

print(f"Overall score: {validation['overall_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Color score: {validation['color_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Body type score: {validation['body_type_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Style score: {validation['style_score']:.2f}")
```

### Color Compatibility Check
```python
# Check specific color compatibility
compatibility = validate_color_skin_tone_compatibility('coral', 'warm')
print(compatibility)
# Output: {
#   'compatible': True,
#   'score': 1.0,
#   'reason': 'coral is flattering for warm skin tone'
# }
```

## Scoring System

### Personalized Layering Score Calculation
The system uses a weighted scoring approach:

- **Temperature Compatibility (30%)**: Basic weather appropriateness
- **Skin Tone Compatibility (20%)**: Color harmony with skin tone
- **Body Type Compatibility (25%)**: Layering approach for body type
- **Style Preference Compatibility (25%)**: Alignment with style preferences

### Score Interpretation
- **0.8-1.0 (A)**: Excellent personalization
- **0.6-0.8 (B)**: Good personalization
- **0.4-0.6 (C)**: Moderate personalization
- **0.0-0.4 (D)**: Poor personalization

**Layout Style:**
- Individual clothing items displayed in separate rectangular boxes/containers
- 2x2 grid on pure white background

- Each item box should have subtle borders or shadows to separate items
- No additional styling, props, or decorative elements
- Professional product photography lighting and angles

**Outfit Details:**
# F-OM6: Polo dress, Cardigan, Boat shoes

**Layout:** 2x2 grid on pure white background

**Style Guidelines:**
- E-commerce product photography aesthetic

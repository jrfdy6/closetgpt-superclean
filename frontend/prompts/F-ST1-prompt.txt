**Layout Style:**
- Individual clothing items displayed in separate rectangular boxes/containers
- 2x3 vertical grid on pure white background
- Flat lay photography style - items photographed from above on white surface
- Each item box should have subtle borders or shadows to separate items
- No additional styling, props, or decorative elements
- Professional product photography lighting and angles

**Outfit Details:**
# F-ST1: Bomber jacket, Graphic tee, Wide-leg cargos, Bucket hat

**Style:** Streetwear aesthetic with oversized, edgy elements

**Style Guidelines:**
- E-commerce product photography aesthetic

**App Context:**
This image will be displayed in a mobile app quiz where users swipe like/dislike on outfits to determine their style preferences. The layout should mimic how items will be displayed in the actual app interface.
